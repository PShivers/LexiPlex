This is a simple word puzzle app that is in development. When done there will be a new puzzle to solve everyday. 
The idea came about when doing the NYT crossword for June 21, 2023 by Natan Last and Andy Kravis from the NYT's one-a-day desk calendar. 
There were three clues in there that inspired me to create an app like wordle but with these word puzzles.
